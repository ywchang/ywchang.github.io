`tag`: `The Effective Executive`

The executive has to make decisions. Actually, everyone can't avoid making decisions. So it will make a big difference if one knows how to make an effective decision. Decision also comes to solve some problems, issues and avoid some events. It means probably, the first lesson of making effective decisions, is to distinguish different types of issues or events.

#### Is this a generic situation or an exception

To start simple, tell the difference between the generic situation and an exceptional event. If some issue just comes very randomly, unexpectedly, it is very hard to predict it and hence avoid it. The exceptional can only be handled as such and as it comes. One example can be the recent news that an airliner was flying while the window suddenly broke out of no reason. The sudden thing will happen in life because we don't always know all the things and can avoid all the risks. 

While the generic is different that we actually can provide some answers through a rule or a principle.

#### The four different types of events

Strictly speaking, one might distinguish between four, rather than between two, different types of occurrences.

There is first the truly generic of which the individual occurrence is only a symptom. As a developer, one of the part of daily working is to fix defects of software. It's not unusual that after fixing quite a few defects in weeks and lots of thinking, a deeper design issue starts to emerge. And then probably a new rule is set up, after which all the defects are gone, including the potential issues that yet to be found. All these defects in the beginning, are symptoms. They are generic issues, but they are not the real problem. In order to solve the real problem, we need to go deeper.

Then there is the problem which, while a unique event for the individual institution, is actually generic. The compay that receives an offer to merge from another, larger one, will never receive such an offer again if it accepts. This is a nonrecurrent situation as far as the individual company, its board of directors, and its management are concerned. But it is, of course, a generic situation which occurs all the time. To think through whether to accept or to reject the offer requires some general rules. For these, however, one has to look to the experence of others. 

Next there is the truly exceptional, the truly unique event. If you believe the dinosaurs were wiped out because of the falling stone from the universe, then this event should be a truly exceptional. You don't expect it happen again soon.

Last but not the least, a new generic problem, is the forth and last category of events with which the decison process deals. This issue deserves a decent decision. 

#### Common mistakes

The effective decision-maker spends time to determine with which of these four situations he is dealing. He knows that he will make the wrong decision if he classifies the situation wrongly. Perhaps exploring the common mistakes is a good way to avoid the wrong classification. 

By far the most common mistake is to treat a generic situation as if it were a series of unique events; that is, to be pragmatic when one lacks the generic understanding and principle. This inevitably leads to frustration and futility. Let's go back to the software defects example again. If a developer submits immediate fix for every defect he meets, then the codebase soon will be full of tricks before not long. All these tricks will be hard to understand and maintain. And don't forget the worst part is that, new issues will keep coming. 

Equally common is the mistake of treating a new event as if it were just another example of the old problem to which, therefore, the old rules should be applied. For example, let's say if there is new virus making people sick, while most of symptoms are similar with already known virus, there is something different. Here if doctors are insensitive, and treat the desease in an old way. It doesn't help and waste time. Probably a big scale of people will eventually die due to the wrong perception in the beginning.

Almost as common is the plausible but erroneous definition of the fundamental problem or the definition of the problem may be incomplete. I can't think of an example in real life here immediately but in software development world, I could share some feeling related to this. When we want to refactor some codes, the primitive codes, like having long methods, many lines of logic are actually not scared. Essentially it can be a good start. Because everything is there and at least it is easy to read and understand. The most difficult are codes being organized in a wrong way. The logic are scattered, hard to follow and trace. It is terrible that you need firstly make things back to previous state and then start it again. Definitely it needs more effort.

#### The cure

The effective decision-maker, therefore always assumes initially that the problem is generic. He always assumes that the event that clamors for his attention is in reality a symptom. He looks for the true problem. He is not content with doctoring the symptom alone. 

And if the event is truly unique, the experienced decision-maker suspect that this heralds a new underlying problem and that what appears as unique will turn out to have been simply the first manifestation of a new generic situation.

Last, The decision-maker also always tests for signs that something atypical, something unusual, is happening; he always asks: “Does the explanation explain the observed events and does it explain all of them?”; he always writes out what the solution is expected to make happen and then tests regularly to see if this really happens; and finally, he goes back and thinks the problem through again when he sees something atypical, when he finds phenomena his explanation does not really explain, or when the course of events deviates, even in details, from his expectations.
