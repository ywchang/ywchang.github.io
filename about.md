Hello! 

My name is Chang Yanwei, I'm a Chinese and I'm also a Software Developer, a Software Engineer, a Programmer, a Software Consultant, or whatever you call someone who writes codes for a living and also doesn't mind helping people solving tech problems.

This is my blog, and I'd like to try my best sharing interesting knowledge and opinions regularly here. The topic is not limited, some are probably related to tech, some are related to people.

I'm also a husband and I have a son.

That's basically me, and if you'd like to connect with me, please feel free to drop me a mail, [changyanwei@gmail.com](changyanwei@gmail.com), thanks!
